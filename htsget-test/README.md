Common test functions and utilities used by [htsget-rs].

[htsget-rs]: https://github.com/umccr/htsget-rs

## Overview

This crate contains shared code used for testing by other htsget-rs crates. It has common server tests, as well as other
utility functions.

## Usage

There is no need to interact with this crate for running htsget-rs.

### As a library

This crate contains `util` functions and `server_tests`. The `server_tests` use some example requests
to test the ticket server and the data block server. To use the `server_tests`, `TestServer` and
`TestRequest` need to be implemented, and then the `test_*` functions can be called.

This library is intended to be used as a [development dependency][dev-dependencies].

#### Feature flags

This crate has the following features:
* `http`: used to enable common functionality for HTTP tests.
* `aws`: used to enable AWS mocking for tests, `S3` location functionality and any other AWS features.
* `url`: used to enable `Url` location functionality.
* `experimental`: used to enable experimental features that aren't necessarily part of the htsget spec, such as Crypt4GH support through `C4GHStorage`.
